# Fresh Linux Setup

Disclaimer: this is mainly for my own personal use but figured i'd share.

This repo contains a list of software/programs I will typically install
on a fresh linux image.  Many of the programs are related to development
and programming and can be obtained via the Debian package manager (aptitude)
however others may be "extra-curricular" :)

I will probably also include other steps/activities in here to get a
fresh Linux install off the ground and ready for development.

## List of aptitude packages

* zsh
* terminator
* python-pip
* fabric
* mongodb
* git
* git-gui
* gnome-do
* npm
* tftpd

## Other programs

* Google Chrome (duh)
* Pycharm
* clion
* rubymine
* webstorm
* thunderbird
* spotify
